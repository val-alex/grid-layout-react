Your task is to create a small web application using React, and style it with SCSS to match a design spec provided.

Please find the designs in the "screenshots" folder. There are 3 images, each for a different screen size.

The aplication will need to fetch some fake user data from a remote JSON API and display the results as shown in the screenshots.

When the "Load More" button is tapped, the application should fetch more users and append them to the page.
